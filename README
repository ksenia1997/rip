With help of Makefile you can compile a project.
 make  - compile a project.
 make clear – delete all files created to build a project.
./myripsniffer -i <interface>, kde význam parametru je následující:
* -i: <interface>  is interface on which packet capture is to be performed

Start timer and for 60 sec will find RIPv1 and RIPv2 packets, after it starts timer again and will find RIPng packet.

./myripresponse -i <interface> -r <IPv6>/[16-128] {-n <IPv6>} {-m [0-16]} {-t [0-65535]}

* -i: <interface> is interface on which packet capture is to be performed;
* -r: v <IPv6> is IP address of capture network and behind the slash is numerical length of the network mask;
* -m: is a RIP Metric, the number of hopes, implicitly is 1;
* -n: <IPv6> is a next-hope address for capture route, implicitly "::";
* -t: is a number of Router Tag, implicitly 0.

Send a RIPng packet with user's parameteres.
Please enter a full IPv6 address.

Examples how to start:

./myripsniffer -i vboxnet0
./myripresponse -i vboxnet0 -r 0124:0123:1232:1232:0000:0000:0000:0000/64
